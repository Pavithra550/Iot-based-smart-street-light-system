             This street lighting is one of the largest energy expenses of a city. A street lighting system can cut municipal street lighting cost is 50% to 70%. The smart street lighting system is a system that adjusts light output based on usage and occupancy. The aim of IoT Based Smart Street Light System is the conservation of energy by reducing electricity wastage as well as reducing manpower. Street Lightning system has a feature as two sensors are used which are Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and Infrared Sensor (IR). The Saved energy can be utilized for various purposes like residential, commercial, etc. This is done by using the LDR sensor. Here the LDR sensor is used ON-OFF the street light based on the ambient intensity level. It is an uncomplicated light/dark activated switch and contains a relay at its output. This switching can be done by a low-cost Wi-Fi module ESP8266 after reading the LDR value. The real-time information of the street light (ON/OFF Status) can be accessed from any time, anywhere through the internet. It ensures high reliability and excellent long-term stability. This work is implemented using a programmed NodeMcu board for providing the required intensity of light at various times. The proposed work has achieved better performance compared to the existing system.
